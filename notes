three kind of things:  raw, list, array.

In value-land, raw + list are represented the same way; a list, which might happen to be one-length. There's probably an accessor method to make this less awkward when actually working with valueland. 

In type-land, all three are distinct, and we have typelist<...> and typearr<N,...> for typed those-things.

Okay, go!
